Installation
============

.. note::
    * These examples assume you are using Debian or another apt-based distribution (Ubuntu, etc).  Adjust accordingly (eg, use yum instead if using RedHat-based distribution).
    * Domogik includes its own xPL hub.  If you are running another xPL hub on your target machine (xpl-perl, etc), you will have to deactivate it before installation.
    * In this example, we use a *mysql* database. If you want to use a *postgresql* database, please refer to :doc:`the specific installations steps for postgresql <postgresql>`.

Dependencies
------------

Check your Python version with: ::

    python -V

.. warning::
    Right now Domogik **requires Python 2.7**. Python 3 is not (yet) fully supported.

If you don't already have Python 2.7 or above (you have it if you are running a recent Linux system), then you can run for example: ::

    $ sudo apt-get install python2.7
    $ sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python

Even if you have python2.7 or higher installed, check that the development package is also installed, or do: ::

    $ sudo apt-get install python2.7-dev gcc

Install SSL libraries: ::

    $ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev 

Install libraries for postgresql: ::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-psycopg2

.. note::
    Even if you plan to use mysql database instead of postgresql, you need to install the *python-psycopg2* package : it is needed by the *alembic* library.

Mysql server
------------

.. warning::
    If you plan to use *postgresql*, please check the :doc:`postgresql installation steps <postgresql>`.

.. note::
    * If you have already a Mysql server installed, you will only have to create the Domogik database.
    * It is highly recommended to use the **innodb engine** (which can be enabled in /etc/mysql/my.cnf)

Install packages for mysql server: ::

    $ sudo apt-get install mysql-server

Log on the mysql database as root user: ::

    $ mysql -u root -p
    Enter password: 

Create a database called "domogik": ::

    mysql> CREATE DATABASE domogik;
    Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

Create the user "domogik" to use the new database: ::

    mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON domogik.* to domogik@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'domopass';
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

    mysql>exit

Download Domogik
----------------

.. warning::
    You must put Domogik sources in a folder which can be read by all the system users:
    
    * don't download Domogik sources in */root* or */*

The 0.4 release is still in development so you need to get domogik from the sources.

Use git to get the sources: ::

    $ sudo apt-get install git
    $ git clone https://github.com/domogik/domogik.git
    $ git checkout master

Install Domogik 
---------------

Since Domogik 0.4, there is no more *install.sh* file. Now you must use the *install.py*: ::

    $ cd domogik/
    $ sudo ./install.py

.. note:: 

    During installation, a new user will be created if necessary.
    
    If you want to use the C xPL hub instead of the python xPL hub, you need to update manually the configuration after Domogik installation. See :doc:`here </xplhub/index>` for more informations on the xpl hub.

.. todo::
    Describe all the steps


Make Domogik start with your computer
-------------------------------------

For Debian or Ubuntu systems: ::

    $ sudo update-rc.d domogik defaults

Start domogik
-------------

::

    $ sudo /etc/init.d/domogik start
    * Starting 0MQ broker ... Done.
    * Starting 0MQ forwarder ... Done.
    * Starting xPL (python version)... Done.
    * Starting Manager (with -d -r -x -s)... Done.
    * Starting the admin interface ... Done.

It will start : 

* The 0MQ broker and forwarder
* The xpl hub
* The Domogik manager on this host
* The database manager and the REST interface module (which will take in account the parameters you defined in your configuration file : host, IP...)
* The administration web interface

Next step : domoweb, the web user interface
-------------------------------------------

Domoweb is not yet available for Domogik 0.4

It doesn't work?
----------------
