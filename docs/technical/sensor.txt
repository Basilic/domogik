A sensor is used to store data received from the xpl network inside the database, this data can then be used to generate charts and display the evolution of some data.

The data stored in the database is linked to a certain `Domogik datatype <package_development/plugins/data_types/index>`.
This datatype is used to interprete the data and to display the correct unit.

A sensor can have different types:
    * **absolute**: store the value as its received
    * **incremental**: store the difference between the last received and the last-1 received value

Some examples of sensors:
    * Temperature sensor
    * Energy sensor (KwH)
    * Power sensor (Watt)
    * boolean input sensor
    * ...
